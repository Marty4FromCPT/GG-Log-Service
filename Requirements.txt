Engineering Task:

Developing a Simple Log Service

Objective:
Develop a simple log service application using serverless functions.

Requirements:
1. The solution should be entirely IAC driven.
2. Create two serverless functions using AWS Lambda or Azure Functions:
* Function 1: Receives a log entry and saves it.
* Function 2: Retrieves the 100 most recent log entries.
3. Log Entry Format:
Each log entry should contain the following fields:
* ID: Unique identifier for the log entry.
* Date Time: Timestamp for when the log was created.
* Severity: One of info, warning, or error.
* Message: The actual log message.
4. Functionality:
* Function 1 should expose an API endpoint to receive log entries and store them.
* Function 2 should expose an API that returns the last 100 log entries in JSON format, sorted by most recent.
5. General Requirements:
* Write the solution in a language of your choice.
* Ensure the code is well-documented, follows best practices, and is easy to understand.
* Push the solution to a GitHub repository and create a pipeline, with clear instructions on how to deploy and run the functions.
* Ensure you follow least privilege principles.
* Utilize encryption to secure your data.
* Make sure your credentials are secured.
* Ensure the pipeline authenticates securely to AWS or Azure using best practices.
* Add security checks to your pipeline.
* Consider security of your API
